Real Time Stock Market Data Pipeline 
AWS Cloud Data Engineering Project |Data Pipeline using Apache Kafka, Python, Glue, S3, Athena

I want to share my latest Data Engineering project where I put my skills to the test by working with an AWS cloud using Apache Kafka and load into Athena

🔬𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: End-to-end data engineering on AWS. Where I ingested data from file to S3 using Kafka, loaded it into Athena. Also used IAM and VPC for data governance. More information can be found in the GitHub repository.
